SlapSpot is a game that displays 10 blue spots randomly moving around a screen.
One-by-one each spot will be highlighted yellow for 3 seconds and the user tries to "slap" the spot
before the time runs out. If they fail to do so the spot will turn red,
otherwise if they did slapthe spot before the times up the spot will turn green.
